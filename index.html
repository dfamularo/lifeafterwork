        <p>Jane from Toowoomba is looking forward to her retirement, which is only a few years away. She wanted to make sure that she was doing everything she could to maximise her super in these last few years without impacting her current lifestyle.</p>
        <p>With a little help, Jane worked out a way to increase the amount she pays into her super through salary sacrifice, without reducing the money she actually takes home every month. This means saving more, but effectively being paid the same.</p>

        <p>Marco’s dream was to travel around Australia when he retired. And that’s exactly what he did, while also growing his super. But how?</p>
        <p>When he retired, Marco wanted to take money from his super to buy a caravan and see more of Australia. With a little help, he worked out how he could take out an initial cash lump sum, while still receiving regular monthly payments from his super.</p>
        <p>Plus, Marco learned that if Marg also moved her super to iQ&nbsp;Retirement, they could link their accounts and pay lower fees.</p>
        <p>Their combined super continued to grow while they were road tripping. It was the perfect solution for them.</p>

        <p>Sixty-eight-year-old Pavel lives in Newcastle, NSW. When he retired, he thought about taking his super as a lump sum to put in his savings account. But he spoke to Russell Investments before doing anything, and we showed him how iQ Retirement could help his money last longer.</p>
        <p>Now Pavel gets tax-free income every month and the rest of his super savings are still invested. It's as if he is being paid a salary, but without all the hard work.</p>
